GOAL : Escape the smart crocodiles, try not to get hit by the pineapples and collect the key to gain ownership of the beach.

Player Movements : A -> moves left
                   D -> moves right 
                   W -> jumps up
                   S -> to shoot bullets
                   G -> to toggle God mode

F2 - Illustrate Hud Pool
F1 - Toggle Hud

AI - The crocodile (enemy sprite) is smart enough to change its direction towards monkey and tries to kill the monkey everytime.
God Mode : When God Mode is ON, the player does not explode on collision with crocodile and when health bar does not decrease. Instead, crocodile collides and explodes.
